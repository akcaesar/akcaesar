# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m Akshay, a machine learning engineer blending backend wizardry with deep learning magic. Currently, I’m working on:
- Developing scalable backend components, REST APIs, and async pipelines (hello, Celery & Redis).
- Building Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and real-time image processing apps.
- Experimenting with 3D visualizations using React + Three.js.

👯 **Collaboration Interests:**
- Machine learning & deep learning projects.
- Scalable Python backend systems (FastAPI, Django, Flask).
- Anything combining ML + deployment at scale.

🤝 **Seeking Help With:**
- Optimizing ML models for real-time use.
- Scaling ML pipelines in production environments.

🌱 **Currently Learning:**
- Advanced deep learning (GANs, RAG, vector databases).
- Cloud deployment tricks for AI systems (Docker, GCP, GitHub Actions).

💬 **Ask Me About:**
- Machine learning, computer vision, backend development.
- Technologies like PyTorch, OpenCV, Celery, Redis, Docker.

⚡ **Fun Fact:**
I published a paper on enhancing image quality in smoke-filled environments using deep learning — yes, it was as smoky and nerdy as it sounds.
